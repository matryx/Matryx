Getting Started
===============

The Matryx Blockchain Platform is a set of Ethereum Smart Contracts that operationally facilitate crowdsourced science, contribution tracking, attribution mechanisms, and authorized timestamps for verifiable data.
The *interfaces* to interact with the Platform is the Matryx WebUI [https://alpha.matryx.ai] or Calcflow [https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1143046855744783/]

Calcflow is a Virtual Reality tool for visualization of 3D mathematics such as parametric equations and vector fields.

To get started with Matryx - you will need a few things.

#. Metamask installed on your browser
#. Matryx Tokens in your Ethereum Wallet

**Metamask** is the most common internet browser enabled crypto wallet for Ethereum is Metamask. [https://www.Metamask.io]
Download the browser extension then go ahead and create or import a wallet.

**Matryx Tokens** are the utility token for the Matryx Platform and are required for full functionality.

A few super helpful how-to videos were made by our teammate @stegosource [https://github.com/Stegosource] which goes through the platform functionality specifically from the WebUI.
